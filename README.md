# Pear Deck UI Kit

![](https://github.com/peardeck/peardeck-uikit/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

A React component library for Pear Deck. This aims to be a set of reusable components, design resources, and guidelines for creating a consistent experience and feel for Pear Deck products.

# Usage

# Development

## Prerequisites:

1. [Node v12.4.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

   We suggest using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) so that you can switch between Node versions as needed. From the project root directory you can insure the appropriate version is installed by running:

   ```
   nvm install
   ```

   Or switch to the required version:

   ```
   nvm use
   ```

1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

## Getting up and running:

```
nvm install

yarn

yarn start
```

This should build the components packages and launch Storybook in your browser.
